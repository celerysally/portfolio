Welcome! This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University!

# About me
Hi everyone, I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University.

3 fun facts about me:
1. My nickname is celery.
2. I watched Friends so much that I memorized the dialogue.
3. Ironically, I do not like celery (the vegetable).

# What I hope to learn

1. Gaining visual critique strategies
2. Developing innovative data visualizations
3. Anything the class has to offer!
