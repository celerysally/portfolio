<p>Which country gets the most paid vacation days?
<a href="https://resume.io/blog/which-country-gets-the-most-paid-vacation-days">https://resume.io/blog/which-country-gets-the-most-paid-vacation-days</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Reason Why I Chose to Redesign this Data Visualization</strong></p>
<p>The map charts on the website &quot;Which country gets the most paid vacation days?&quot; (Resume.io) offer a valuable starting point for understanding global vacation policies. However, there&#39;s room for improvement to enhance clarity and provide a more comprehensive picture.</p>
<p>Visual Clutter: Crowding numerous countries and their specific vacation day numbers onto a single map can be visually overwhelming and difficult to interpret. A redesign could explore alternative visualizations like bar charts or heatmaps for specific regions. Zooming in on specific areas with high or low vacation days could reveal interesting patterns.</p>
<p>Limited Interactivity: The current static map charts offer limited user engagement.  A redesign could incorporate interactive elements like tooltips or hover effects. Hovering over a country could reveal detailed information about its vacation policies, specific laws, or industry standards. </p>
<p>By addressing these limitations, a redesigned visualization could become a powerful tool for a wider audience. It could empower employees and job seekers to understand global vacation trends and policymakers to consider evidence-based approaches to work-life balance legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization</strong></p>
<p>Before redesigning, I criticized the data visualization through multiple steps of in-depth thinking. I felt the usefulness of the chart was slightly above average, a 6/10. The visualization did not have all the necessary data to provide context to the perusers, such as the work cultures in different countries. The visuals are also extremely cluttered and hard to read, especially the maps with too much text, requiring concentration to follow the lines from the texts to the countries. There is limited interactivity, and reading the map is unintuitive as no obvious takeaway presents itself. Rather, the viewer is left to extract their conclusions from a mass of cluttered and poorly presented data. The visual clutter and unnecessary zoom-ins at random places make the figure ugly and make readers want to avoid it. Further, the mass of cluttered lines and zoom-ins distract from the main data that the graph is trying to present.</p>
<p>Good parts:</p>
<p>The colored map charts stood out, helping with the comprehension of the overall ranking of each country. Also, the large, bold title further enhanced the visualization&#39;s clarity, ensuring that the audience instantly grasped the subject matter. It served as an effective anchor, guiding viewers&#39; focus and setting the context for the information presented. Additionally, the legend label clearly indicated the various colors used in the map, ensuring that the data was not only visually appealing but also informative. The combination of these elements worked harmoniously to create a visualization that was engaging and quite easy to understand.</p>
<p>Possible Improvements:</p>
<p>The presence of small numbers and country names surrounding the map made the chart overwhelming and hard to read, and it became especially confusing when multiple numbers were indicated in a single area. For example, looking at Russia, there were three different numbers, which made it unclear because multiple figures were presented in one country. Although the country names were written below, the large, bold numbers caught my eye first, adding to the confusion. Close-ups of certain areas further complicated the visualization, making it less aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, the brief descriptions explaining trends or fun facts seemed unnecessary. The emphasis on the top 10 countries listed in the top left corner also felt redundant, occupying space that could be better utilized. Similarly, the art depicting the topic, such as a person celebrating public holidays or the suitcase next to the title, while adding a friendly touch, appeared unnecessary. These elements could be removed to increase the size of the legend label, enhancing readability and overall visual clarity.</p>
<p>The article highlights the paid vacation days worldwide, particularly the generous offerings of European countries, and emphasizes the significance of work-life balance and the positive impact of paid vacation on employee well-being. Notably, the article underscores the U.S.&#39;s unique position as one of the few developed nations without federal paid vacation requirements. </p>
<p>The primary audience for this article is employees, job seekers, HR professionals, and policymakers interested in global vacation policies. Employees could be curious about vacation policies around the world, especially those who feel their current policy is inadequate or who might be considering relocating work. For job seekers, actively searching for new jobs and wanting to compare potential benefits packages, particularly paid vacation days. They might use this tool to prioritize countries or companies offering generous vacation policies. HR Professionals could get ideas for revising their company vacation policies, and this tool can provide them with a global perspective and help with their decision-making. Also, with the emphasis in the article on the importance of a healthy work-life balance, policymakers could use this data to inform policy changes regarding paid vacation time.</p>
<p>The data itself is effective and valuable since it would be easy for the audience to compare paid days off with multiple countries. However, it could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the different patterns of paid days off in these countries. Paid days off are influenced by various factors, including working culture and other potential influences, and exploring these would provide a richer understanding of the data. Further, the visualization was not effective since the numbers and the names of the countries were all cluttered and difficult to read. Moreover, it could have been beneficial to have the mean and median sections for the data visualizations for better comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Brainstorming Redesign Sketches</strong></p>

All data is lifted from:
  Makeover Monday [Website]. (2022, Week 50). Which country gets the most paid vacation days? [Data set]. Retrieved from <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2022w50">https://data.world/makeovermonday/2022w50</a>

  
<p>1. Comparison between the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<p>The article highlighted the U.S.'s relatively low ranking in terms of paid vacation days compared to other countries. To emphasize this disparity, I chose to focus on a comparison between the U.S. and the top 10 countries with the most generous vacation policies. While the title might be a bit lengthy, it accurately conveys the central theme of the visualization.
    </p>
  <p>A bar chart was the most suitable format for this comparison, as it clearly illustrates the numerical differences in vacation days. To draw attention to the U.S.'s position, I highlighted the corresponding bar and used a muted color scheme for the other countries. Including numerical labels on each bar provides precise information, allowing viewers to easily compare values.</p>

<p>To ensure a clean and focused visualization, I carefully considered the design of the tooltip. I aimed to provide relevant information without overwhelming the viewer. By keeping the tooltip concise and informative, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience.</p>

<p>2. Map Chart Redesigns</p>

<p>I opted for a minimalist approach, using three simple map charts to highlight each factor: paid vacation days, public holidays, and paid leave days. This streamlined design avoided visual clutter and allowed the key data points to stand out. The clear and concise titles effectively conveyed the purpose of each chart.
  </p>
<p>While Tableau provided a user-friendly platform for creating these visualizations, I encountered limitations in conveying granular details like specific day counts and country names. The original map chart, though information-rich, suffered from visual complexity, making it difficult to interpret. By focusing on the core message and simplifying the design, I aimed to create a more effective and visually appealing visualization.

<p><strong>Step 4: Peer Feedback</strong></p>
<p>I asked for peer feedback for both of my graphic elements. I present the bar chart as Fig. 1 and the redesigned series of world maps as Fig. 2.</p>
<p>I asked my peers using ten questions (presented below) and summarized them into strengths and weaknesses for my visuals.</p>
<p>A Mix of Ten Questions presented to Peers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you tell me what you think this is?</li>
<li>Can you describe to me what this is telling you?</li>
<li>Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</li>
<li>Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</li>
<li>Is there anything you would change or do differently?</li>
<li>What is your overall impression of the visualization?</li>
<li>Is the visualization easy to understand?</li>
<li>Is the visualization visually appealing?</li>
<li>Does the visualization effectively communicate the intended message?</li>
<li>What do you think the most important takeaway from the visualization is?</li>
</ul>
<p>Peer Feedback</p>

<p>Student, mid 20’s</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can you tell me what you think this is?<br>It looks like a graph comparing, or rather, contrasting, how few paid vacation days US companies give their employees as compared to other countries.</li>
  <li>Can you describe to me what this is telling you?<br>It tells me that the US employees receive 3 to 5x fewer holidays than other countries worldwide, speaking more about the horrible state of workers rights and benefits in the US.</li>
  <li>Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?<br>No, It is pretty clear what the graph is trying to say. I like the US being in a different colour. The US treating employees this poorly is surprising.</li>
  <li>Who do you think is the intended audience for this?<br>This is for showing american workers the discrepency in employee treatment in different countries, especially for those looking to seek better worker treatment by going abroad.</li>
  <li>Is there anything you would change or do differently?<br>I would add the mean and median of worldwide countries.</li>
  <li>What is your overall impression of the visualization?<br>I like how the Axes are laid out and the colour. contrasting of the US.</li>
  <li>Is the visualization easy to understand?<br>Yes it is easy to understand.</li>
  <li>Is the visualization visually appealing?<br>Yes I like the color scheme and the easy-on-the-eyes design language. The visual is easy to read and not complicated.</li>
  <li>Does the visualization effectively communicate the intended message?<br>Yes it does, though it would have been nicer if the title scremed the intended message as well.</li>
  <li>What do you think the most important takeaway from the visualization is?<br>My takeaway is that the US treats it's employees much worse than other countries globally w.r.t the number of paid holidays.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Adult, late 20’s</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is this visualization about?<br>This visualization is a horizontal bar chart comparing the total number of paid vacation days in various countries. It highlights the significant difference in vacation policies between the United States and other countries, particularly those with higher average vacation days. The other figure is a map chart representing each country with difference in color.</li>
  <li>What does the visualization tell me?<br>The visualization clearly shows that the United States has significantly fewer paid vacation days compared to the other countries listed. The contrasting color for the U.S. bar immediately draws attention to this disparity.</li>
  <li>Is there anything surprising or confusing?<br>While the visualization is straightforward, one might be surprised by the stark contrast between the U.S. and other countries, especially those with similar economic development.</li>
  <li>Who is the intended audience?<br>The intended audience likely includes employees and individuals interested in work-life balance. The visualization effectively communicates the need for potential policy changes in the U.S. to align with international standards.</li>
  <li>What could be improved?<br>The following could be done:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Contextual Information: Adding context about the specific countries, such as their economic status, labor laws, and cultural factors, could provide a more nuanced understanding of the variations in vacation policies.</li>
      <li>Interactive Features: Incorporating interactive elements like tooltips or hover effects could allow users to explore the data in more detail. For example, hovering over a bar could reveal specific information about the country's vacation policies.</li>
      <li>Data Source and Methodology: Providing information about the data source and the methodology used to collect and analyze the data would enhance the credibility and transparency of the visualization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall Impression: The visualization is effective in highlighting the significant disparity in paid vacation days between the U.S. and other countries. It is clear, concise, and visually appealing. However, adding more context and interactive features could further enrich the user experience and provide deeper insights.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Summarized Feedback:</p>
<p>Fig 1: Bar Chart</p>

Strengths: 
<ul>
<li>Clear Message: The visualization effectively highlights the stark contrast between the U.S. and other countries in terms of paid vacation days. The title is also designed to clearly communicate the takeaway rather than just present a blob of data.</li>
<li><p>Visual Clarity: The use of a contrasting color for the U.S. bar and the simple bar chart design make the message easily understandable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
Weaknesses: 
<ul> 
<li>Lack of Context: While the visualization effectively highlights the disparity, adding contexts, like average global vacation days or regional comparisons, could provide further insights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fig 2: Series of World Maps</p>
Strengths: 
<ul>
<li>Interactive Element: The tooltip feature enhances user experience by providing detailed information on hover.</li>
<li>Visual Appeal: The color-coded maps are visually appealing and easy to interpret.</li>
<li><p>Global Perspective: The series of maps provides a comprehensive overview of vacation policies across different regions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Weaknesses: A weakness is that we are unable to add in-depth information to the maps since it would look cluttered like the original article's maps. Feedback mentioned I should use tooltips to present this information. The feedback also recommended including cultural references, which cause the disparity in paid leave between countries.
</li>
<ul>

</ul>
 
<p><strong>Step 5: Final Redesigned Visualization</strong></p>
<p>Using the feedback from peers, I redesigned the first bar sketch by adding a mean and color coding the USA bar and the mean to draw attention to them. I also changed the title to summarize the main takeaway of the graph instead of just reiterating what the graph already presents. Also, I excluded the use of maps and chose the top 10 countries to reduce visual clutter (unlike the Makeover Monday video, where they redesigned by listing all the countries) and draw focus to the main point of juxtapositioning the leave situation of the US as compared to other top countries while minimizing visual clutter. The bar chart also allows me to present more in-depth information without overwhelming the perusers. I kept the simple tooltip interactivity to increase user experience and fun. I also added the quantitative numbers of the bars at the right of the bar to increase user eye travel. Furthermore, I removed the label on the y-axis since the names of the countries make the y-axis variables obvious. By recreating the overwhelming map charts, I feel confident that the viewers will be able to grasp the key ideas of the article. In addition, the redesigned bar chart supports the main topic of the article and highlights how the US has the least paid vacation days.   </p>
<p>The overall process of the critique and redesigning helped me better grasp the idea of what to look for in a data visualization. This method proved valuable in analyzing the pros and cons of a particular data visualization and evaluating its effectiveness in conveying information to the audience. However, I found that a more structured evaluation process would have been beneficial, as it is easy to have scattered thoughts without clear guidelines. For instance, when criticizing a visualization, my thoughts tend to scatter around, making it difficult to think of the next step or the next part I should criticize. Moreover, since all the visualizations floating around the internet could be very different, I believe it is beneficial to have a more defined section for each part of a visualization, such as a title, chart, description, etc., which would have helped organize my thoughts more systematically as well. I also learned that no matter how great the data itself can be, data visualization, whether it be a bar chart, map chart, heat map, line graph, etc., defines the story of the data. Although a visualization is better than a data dump of endless rows of numbers and numerous columns, it is critical to know what data to represent as a visualization. This exercise reminded me how important it is to have the data visualizations to be aligned with the overall article as well. As mentioned above, the article mentions the average paid vacation days in each country and also states that the US is at the bottom of the list and lacks a good work-life balance. </p>
