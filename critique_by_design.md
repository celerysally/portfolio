**Step 1: Reason Why I Chose to Redesign this Data Visualization**

The map charts on the website "Which country gets the most paid vacation days?" (Resume.io) offer a valuable starting point for understanding global vacation policies. However, there's room for improvement to enhance clarity and provide a more comprehensive picture.

Visual Clutter: Crowding numerous countries and their specific vacation day numbers onto a single map can be visually overwhelming and difficult to interpret. A redesign could explore alternative visualizations like bar charts or heatmaps for specific regions. Zooming in on specific areas with high or low vacation days could reveal interesting patterns.

Limited Interactivity: The current static map charts offer limited user engagement.  A redesign could incorporate interactive elements like tooltips or hover effects. Hovering over a country could reveal detailed information about its vacation policies, specific laws, or industry standards. 


By addressing these limitations, a redesigned visualization could become a powerful tool for a wider audience. It could empower employees and job seekers to understand global vacation trends and policymakers to consider evidence-based approaches to work-life balance legislation.


**Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization**


Before redesigning, I criticized the data visualization through multiple steps of in-depth thinking. I felt the usefulness of the chart was slightly above average, a 6/10. The visualization did not have all the necessary data to provide context to the perusers, such as the work cultures in different countries. The visuals are also extremely cluttered and hard to read, especially the maps with too much text, requiring concentration to follow the lines from the texts to the countries. There is limited interactivity, and reading the map is unintuitive as no obvious takeaway presents itself. Rather, the viewer is left to extract their conclusions from a mass of cluttered and poorly presented data. The visual clutter and unnecessary zoom-ins at random places make the figure ugly and make readers want to avoid it. Further, the mass of cluttered lines and zoom-ins distract from the main data that the graph is trying to present.


Good parts:

The colored map charts stood out, helping with the comprehension of the overall ranking of each country. Also, the large, bold title further enhanced the visualization's clarity, ensuring that the audience instantly grasped the subject matter. It served as an effective anchor, guiding viewers' focus and setting the context for the information presented. Additionally, the legend label clearly indicated the various colors used in the map, ensuring that the data was not only visually appealing but also informative. The combination of these elements worked harmoniously to create a visualization that was engaging and quite easy to understand.


Possible Improvements:

The presence of small numbers and country names surrounding the map made the chart overwhelming and hard to read, and it became especially confusing when multiple numbers were indicated in a single area. For example, looking at Russia, there were three different numbers, which made it unclear because multiple figures were presented in one country. Although the country names were written below, the large, bold numbers caught my eye first, adding to the confusion. Close-ups of certain areas further complicated the visualization, making it less aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, the brief descriptions explaining trends or fun facts seemed unnecessary. The emphasis on the top 10 countries listed in the top left corner also felt redundant, occupying space that could be better utilized. Similarly, the art depicting the topic, such as a person celebrating public holidays or the suitcase next to the title, while adding a friendly touch, appeared unnecessary. These elements could be removed to increase the size of the legend label, enhancing readability and overall visual clarity.


The article highlights the paid vacation days worldwide, particularly the generous offerings of European countries, and emphasizes the significance of work-life balance and the positive impact of paid vacation on employee well-being. Notably, the article underscores the U.S.'s unique position as one of the few developed nations without federal paid vacation requirements. 

The primary audience for this article is employees, job seekers, HR professionals, and policymakers interested in global vacation policies. Employees could be curious about vacation policies around the world, especially those who feel their current policy is inadequate or who might be considering relocating work. For job seekers, actively searching for new jobs and wanting to compare potential benefits packages, particularly paid vacation days. They might use this tool to prioritize countries or companies offering generous vacation policies. HR Professionals could get ideas for revising their company vacation policies, and this tool can provide them with a global perspective and help with their decision-making. Also, with the emphasis in the article on the importance of a healthy work-life balance, policymakers could use this data to inform policy changes regarding paid vacation time.


The data itself is effective and valuable since it would be easy for the audience to compare paid days off with multiple countries. However, it could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the different patterns of paid days off in these countries. Paid days off are influenced by various factors, including working culture and other potential influences, and exploring these would provide a richer understanding of the data. Further, the visualization was not effective since the numbers and the names of the countries were all cluttered and difficult to read. Moreover, it could have been beneficial to have the mean and median sections for the data visualizations for better comparison.

**Step 3: Brainstorming Redesign Sketches**

**Step 4: Peer Feedback**

I asked for peer feedback for both of my graphic elements. I present the bar chart as Fig. 1 and the redesigned series of world maps as Fig. 2.

I asked my peers using ten questions (presented below) and summarized them into strengths and weaknesses for my visuals.

Ten Questions presented to Peers:
* Can you tell me what you think this is?
* Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
* Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
* Is there anything you would change or do differently?
* What is your overall impression of the visualization?
* Is the visualization easy to understand?
* Is the visualization visually appealing?
* Does the visualization effectively communicate the intended message?
* What do you think the most important takeaway from the visualization is?

Summarized Feedback:

Fig 1: Bar Chart

* Strengths:
- Clear Message: The visualization effectively highlights the stark contrast between the U.S. and other countries in terms of paid vacation days. The title is also designed to clearly communicate the takeaway rather than just present a blob of data.
- Visual Clarity: The use of a contrasting color for the U.S. bar and the simple bar chart design make the message easily understandable.

* Weaknesses:
- Lack of Context: While the visualization effectively highlights the disparity, adding context like average global vacation days or regional comparisons could provide further insights.

Fig 2: Series of World Maps

* Strengths:
- Interactive Element: The tooltip feature enhances user experience by providing detailed information on hover.
- Visual Appeal: The color-coded maps are visually appealing and easy to interpret.
- Global Perspective: The series of maps provides a comprehensive overview of vacation policies across different regions.

* Weaknesses:
- Data Density: The maps could become cluttered, especially for countries with complex political boundaries.
- Missing Context: While the maps effectively show the distribution of vacation days, additional context such as economic indicators or cultural factors could provide deeper insights.

Overall, both visualizations effectively convey the core message of the disparity in paid vacation days. However, there is room for improvement in terms of contextual information.
