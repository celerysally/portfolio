### 2. Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals to Interview 🤝

Many of my friends and colleagues visit NYC during the summer, many of them being current CMU graduate students who value convenience and comfort when they travel.

To ensure a variety of perspectives based on different usage patterns, I decided to interview:
- A CMU Phd student who visits NYC frequently
- A music producer who has a busy schedule
- An international traveler
