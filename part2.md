## User Research & Interviews üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### 1. Target Audience üë•

- Travelers or Tourists who frequently use Uber for airport transportation in June, especially those traveling to or from JFK and LGA.
  - Age Range: Primarily 18-55 years old who prioritize comfort and convenience
  - Geographic Location: Domestic and international travelers arriving or departing from New York City, particularly those heading to or from JFK and LGA
  - Tech-Savviness: Comfortable using smartphones and rideshare apps
 
- New Yorkers and commuters who are interested in the cost of air travel and the convenience of rideshare services.
  - Age Range: Primarily 25-50 years old, with a focus on professionals who frequently travel for work or personal reasons
  - Geographic Location: Primarily New York City residents, with a focus on those living in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens
  - Interest in Pricing Trends: May regularly compare different transport options for cost-effectiveness

### 2. Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals to Interview ü§ù

Many of my friends and colleagues visit NYC during the summer, many of them being current CMU graduate students who value convenience and comfort when they travel.

To ensure a variety of perspectives based on different usage patterns, I decided to interview:
- An international traveler
- A CMU Phd student who visits NYC every summer 
- A music producer who has a busy schedule and travels frequently

### 3. Interview Script üí¨

| Question | Interviewee 1 | Interviewee 2 | Interviewee 3 | 
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| _What mode of transportation do you typically use to travel between JFK/LGA and NYC?_ | Usually, I take an Uber or Lyft. | Subway or sometimes Uber. | Always Uber or Lyft. |
| _Is there a specific reason for that transportation?_ | I tend to take the most comfortable transportation, especially after a 12-14 hour flight. Also, with the big and heavy luggage, I'm not taking them up and down the stairs. | Subway: It's cheaper, and I don't like cars that much because there is alternate transportation that's environmentally friendly. Uber: If I have 2 suitcases, I'll Uber because there's a lack of elevators, and the narrow stairs make it hard to move with suitcases when using the subway. Also, the turnstiles are too small for the suitcases. | Saving time and comfort are my top priorities. |
| _Who do you think the target audience is?_ | Tourists or anyone visiting NYC. | People who cannot take public transportation because they don't have a train. Or for people who are late at night and find it unsafe to take the train late at night. | People who travel from the airport to NYC and vice versa.
| _Was the content clear to follow?_ | It was clear to follow, although there was a lot of information overall. | It looks clear to follow. | Yes, it was pretty clear. |
| _Do the data visualizations align with the main topic?_ | Yes, they clearly align with the topic. | Yes. | It does. |
| _What is one key takeaway?_ | Depending on the location, an Uber trip could cost as much as a flight ticket. That's actually wild. | Uber charges more to travelers during peak season, which is unfair to consumers. | Did not know Uber has an airport shuttle. |
| _Were the visualizations easy to understand?_ | They were easy to understand. | Yes. | Yes, they were pretty simple, too. |
| _How does the color scheme make you feel?_ | I liked the consistency of colors that you used. | Looks nice. | I like it, but you could have used other colors. |
| _If you could make any improvements, what would it be?_ | Could have used a variety of different types of charts or graphs. | I would use a color scheme to represent negative points in the graph in red, positive in green, and neutral in yellow. | Carefully choose what colors to use. |

### 4. Findings from the Interviews üîç

Here are 5 key takeaways from the interview:

- Respondents typically use Uber or Lyft to travel between JFK/LGA and NYC, with a few opting for the subway depending on convenience and luggage.
- One respondent values the subway for its lower cost and environmental friendliness, while others choose Uber or Lyft for their comfort, particularly when carrying multiple suitcases.
- The target audience that the interviewees had in mind was not the same.
- Respondents found the content relatively easy to follow.
- The data visualizations were deemed to align well with the main topic of airport transportation options, helping to support the message.

### 5. Changes I Plan on Implementing to My Visualizations üí°

- Provide further explanation and include additional details for clarity
- Reevaluate the color scheme and select the most appropriate colors
- Consider alternative graphs and charts that could better present the data
- Avoid overwhelming the audience with excessive data
